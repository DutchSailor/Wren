# WikiHouse Wren

The language and rules for the Wikihouse structural system for 1-3 storey buildings, initially developed in the UK for European contexts.

Wren components are CNC manufuctured using structural-grade timber panel materials (typically, plywood) and can be rapidly assembled to produce a structural chassis, onto which other components such as cladding, windows, doors can be fitted.

Wren is in development. For full documentation on how Wren works and how you can contribute to its development, visit the [Wren wiki](https://github.com/wikihouseproject/Wren/wiki)
