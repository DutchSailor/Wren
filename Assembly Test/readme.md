## Wren Hardware

Wren components are CNC manufuctured using structural-grade timber panel materials (typically, plywood) and can be rapidly assembled to produce a structural chassis.

#### Wren is in development. For full documentation on how Wren works and how you can contribute to its development, visit the [Wren wiki](https://github.com/wikihouseproject/Wren/wiki)
